{"script": "Ever wonder how your phone predicts your next word? That\u2019s a neural network at work! Imagine your brain learning to guess the next word in a sentence\u2014like predicting \u2018dog\u2019 after \u2018fetch\u2019\u2014but way faster. Neural networks use layers of simple math to spot patterns in text, making them smarter than old-school word-guessing tools. Why does it matter? They power everything from autocorrect to chatbots, making tech more intuitive. So next time your phone nails your typo, thank a neural network!", "duration": 28.264438, "video_path": "/Users/lianmatsuo/Developer/KCL/6CCSAHAI/coursework_1/video_service_v2/cache/edb182b284548031640b7b4ab284299e.mp4", "topic": "Nns", "subtopic": "Main Content", "concept": "Nns", "cache_key": "edb182b284548031640b7b4ab284299e"}
