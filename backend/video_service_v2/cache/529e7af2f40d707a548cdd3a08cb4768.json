{"script": "Ever tried to remember a story word by word? That\u2019s what RNNs do! They\u2019re neural networks that remember past data, like reading a sentence and predicting the next word. Imagine a detective piecing together clues\u2014each new clue helps them guess what happened next. RNNs work the same way, analyzing sequences in speech or text. Why does this matter? Because they power voice assistants, translate languages, and even predict stock trends. Without RNNs, AI wouldn\u2019t understand context\u2014just like a detective without clues!", "duration": 30.171375, "video_path": "/Users/lianmatsuo/Developer/KCL/6CCSAHAI/coursework_1/video_service_v2/cache/529e7af2f40d707a548cdd3a08cb4768.mp4", "topic": "Rnns", "subtopic": "Main Content", "concept": "Rnns", "cache_key": "529e7af2f40d707a548cdd3a08cb4768"}
