{"script": "Ever tried to remember a story word by word? That\u2019s what RNNs do! They\u2019re neural networks that process sequences\u2014like sentences or time series\u2014by looping information back into themselves. Imagine reading a book where each page reminds you of the last one. That\u2019s an RNN! It\u2019s great for tasks like predicting the next word in a sentence or translating languages. Without RNNs, AI would struggle with anything that unfolds over time. They\u2019re the secret sauce behind chatbots, voice assistants, and even stock market predictions.
